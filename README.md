# Hritik Suman 
Hi, I'm Hritik Suman👋 pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science Engineering from Jaypee Institute of Information Technology, Noida. Previously worked on <b>Collaborative clustering</b> where the goal was to identify structures in each local data set considered by different algorithms. I live in Noida, IN and am an North origin.

## My Previous Projects 💻
🌟 <b>Collobrative Clustering</b>
    <ul><li>Improves clustering process by combining different cluster algorithms.</li>
      <li>Collobrate different clustering algorithms k-mean, k -medoids, DBSCAN and hierarchical.</li>
    </ul>
🌀 <b>Phishing Urls Detector:</b><br> 
    <ul><li>Detect phishing URLs using ML technology independent of the blacklist, with an accuracy of 89%.</li>
        <li>Phishing URL Detector has both web and browser extension applications.</li>
    </ul>
🍏 <b>Machine learing Tool:</b><br>
    <ul><li>Tools for non-tech people to use machine learning technology without any intermediate knowledge.</li>
        <li>The tool can perform multiple object classification and train model based on cluster object image data.</li>
    </ul>

## Familiar with
<ul><li>Algorithms and Data structure</li>
  <li>Machine learning</li>
